= Setting the SameSite attribute on cookies with Open Liberty

On Open Liberty, you can now specify the `SameSite` cookie attribute for your application-defined cookies, as well as for the session and security cookies, and any cookie added to the response by the server, in your server configuration and minimize application-level changes. The `SameSite` cookie attribute is used by web browsers to determine if a particular cookie should be sent with a request.

Until recently, if the attribute wasn't set, Google Chrome assumed the value of the attribute to be `None` and allowed third-party cookies to track users across multiple sites. A recent change to Chrome (and other web browsers will follow), however, has changed this default behavior so that cookies are only sent for "same-site" and "cross-site" top-level navigations specified in the cookie (`Lax`). To change this behaviour, the `SameSite` attribute must be explicitly set.

The Servlet specification does not offer any API to set the `SameSite` attribute on a link:{url-prefix}/docs/ref/javaee/8/#package=javax/servlet/http/package-frame.html&class=javax/servlet/http/Cookie.html[Cookie] so there historically was only one way to set the `SameSite` attribute on cookies in Open Liberty and that was to manually write the `Set-Cookie` header and add it to the link:{url-prefix}/docs/ref/javaee/8/#package=javax/servlet/http/package-frame.html&class=javax/servlet/http/HttpServletResponse.html[HttpServletResponse]. The update in Open Liberty 20.0.0.3 means that you can specify the `SameSite` cookie attribute for your application-defined cookies. These new server configurations help minimize application-level changes due to the new handling of the `SameSite` attribute.

== What is the SameSite cookie attribute?

The `SameSite` attribute is used by web browsers to determine if a particular cookie should be sent with a request. Setting this attribute can help protect against Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. There are three values for the `SameSite` attribute: `Lax`, `Strict`, `None`:

`SameSite=Strict`:: The cookie is only sent with "same-site" requests. The cookie is only sent by the web browser if the site for the cookie matches the site in the address bar for example.
`SameSite=Lax`:: The cookie is sent with both "same-site" and "cross-site" top-level navigation requests. Clicking a link, for example.
`SameSite=None`:: The cookie is sent with both "same-site" and "cross-site" requests. The cookie is sent by the web browser for third-party contexts, embedded content, for example.

== What's changing with the SameSite cookie attribute?

Google Chrome and other web browsers are starting to change how they deal with cookies that do not have a `SameSite` attribute defined. There are two main changes:

- Cookies without a `SameSite` attribute are treated as if they have the `SameSite` attribute value of `Lax` (instead of `None`, which was the previous browser behavior).
- Cookies defined as having a `SameSite` attribute value of `None` now also require that you define the `Secure` attribute.

The `SameSite` attribute is not a new concept and is detailed in great length here: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-03#section-4.1.2.7[HTTP State Management Mechanism]. Until recently web browsers have treated a Cookie without a `SameSite` attribute as having a `SameSite` attribute value of `None`. Details of the new enforcement that has been adopted by Chrome and by other browser in future can be found here: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-cookie-incrementalism-00[Incrementally Better Cookies]

== Setting the SameSite attribute

Open Liberty is providing three new ways of setting the `SameSite` attribute because it is not possible to set the `SameSite` attribute using the link:{url-prefix}docs/ref/javaee/8/#package=javax/servlet/http/package-frame.html&class=javax/servlet/http/Cookie.html[Cookie API].

Previously, the only available way to set the `SameSite` attribute using the Servlet specification is specifically defining a `Set-Cookie` header using the following two HttpServletResponse APIs:

- link:{url-prefix}/docs/ref/javaee/8/#package=javax/servlet/http/package-frame.html&class=javax/servlet/http/HttpServletResponse.html#setHeader-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-[HttpServletResponse.setHeader]
- link:{url-prefix}/docs/ref/javaee/8/#package=javax/servlet/http/package-frame.html&class=javax/servlet/http/HttpServletResponse.html#addHeader-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-[HttpServletResponse.addHeader]

Now, there are three new ways to set the `SameSite` attribute in Open LIberty in the `server.xml` configuration:

- For the session cookie
- For the LTPA/JWT security cookies
- For other cookies 

(This work was completed in the  https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/10086[Allow the SameSite attribute to be set on a Cookie] issue.)

=== Setting the SameSite attribute for the session cookie

In the `server.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<httpSession cookieSameSite="Lax|Strict|None|Disabled"/>
----

The default value of `cookieSameSite` is `Disabled`. The `Disabled` value means that no `SameSite` attribute is added to the session cookie.

If the `None` value is used for `cookieSameSite`, the `Secure` attribute is automatically added to the session cookie.

=== Setting the SameSite attribute for the LTPA/JWT security cookies

In the `server.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<webAppSecurity sameSiteCookie="Lax|Strict|None|Disabled"/>
----

The default value of `sameSiteCookie` is `Disabled`. The `Disabled` value means that no `SameSite` attribute is added to the security cookies.

If the `None` value is used for `sameSiteCookie`, the `Secure` attribute is automatically added to the security cookies.

=== Setting the SameSite attribute for other cookies

In the `server.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<httpEndpoint id="defaultHttpEndpoint"
              httpPort="9080"
              httpsPort="9443" >
   <samesite lax="chocolateChip,oatmeal" strict="peanutButter" none="sugar"/>
</httpEndpoint>
----

Each attribute of the `samesite` element takes a comma (`,`) deliminted list of cookie names.

In the example, cookies with the following names would have the `SameSite` attribute defined as follows:
- `chocolateChip` and `oatmeal` have a `SameSite` attribute of `Lax`
- `peanutButter` have a `SameSite` attribute of `Strict`
- `sugar` have a `SameSite` attribute of `None` and the `Secure` attribute is automatically added

The `httpEndpoint` configuration adds the `SameSite` attribute to a cookie only if it does not already exist.

The `httpEndpoint` configuration gives the ability to add the `SameSite` attribute to cookies added with the link:{url-prefix}/docs/ref/javaee/8/#package=javax/servlet/http/package-frame.html&class=javax/servlet/http/HttpServletResponse.html#setHeader-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-[HttpServletResponse.setHeader] and link:{url-prefix}/docs/ref/javaee/8/#package=javax/servlet/http/package-frame.html&class=javax/servlet/http/HttpServletResponse.html#addHeader-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-[HttpServletResponse.addHeader] methods, as well as any cookies added using link:{url-prefix}/docs/ref/javaee/8/#package=javax/servlet/http/package-frame.html&class=javax/servlet/http/HttpServletResponse.html#addCookie-javax.servlet.http.Cookie-#addHeader-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-[HttpServletResponse.addCookie(Cookie cookie)].

The link:{url-prefix}/docs/ref/config/#httpEndpoint.html#samesite[`httpEndpoint` configuration] also supports the wildcard character (`*`).

In the following example, all cookies added by the application and the server have the SameSite attribute set to `Lax`:

[source,xml]
----
<samesite lax="*"/>
----

In the following example, `sugar` has the SameSite attribute set to `None` and the Secure attribute added, `peanutButter` has the SameSite attribute set to `Strict`, and all other cookies have the SameSite attribute set to `Lax`:

[source,xml]
----
<samesite lax="*" strict="peanutButter" none="suga*"/>
----

If the `httpSession` and/or `webAppSecurity` configurations are not set, given the above examples, the session cookie's `SameSite` attribute value is `Lax` and the security cookie's `SameSite` attribute value is `Lax`.

Any number of cookie names can contain the wildcard character at the end and, for any given cookie name, the most specific pattern is matched. Only one standalone wildcard character is allowed and the following example shows an invalid configuration because each cookie name or pattern can be defined only as one of `none`, `lax`, or `strict`:

[source,xml]
----
<samesite lax="*" strict="*"/>
----

If you have a SameSite configuration to use in multiple endpoints, you can create the configuration in one locaton and refer to it from the server configuration of each endpoint. For example:

[source,xml]
----
<httpEndpoint id="defaultHttpEndpoint"
              httpPort="9080"
              httpsPort="9443"
              samesiteRef="samesiteReference">
</httpEndpoint>
<samesite strict="cookieOne" id="samesiteReference"/>
----

Finally, the configuration for `httpSession` and `webAppSecurity` take precedence over the `httpEndpoint` configuration, if set. In the following example, the session cookie with the name `JSESSIONID` (the default session cookie name) has the `SameSite` attribute set to `Lax`:

[source,xml]
----
<httpSession cookieSameSite="Lax"/>
<httpEndpoint id="defaultHttpEndpoint"
              httpPort="9080"
              httpsPort="9443" >
   <samesite strict="JSESSIONID"/>
</httpEndpoint>
----


== Summary
Google Chrome and other web browsers are changing how they treat cookies that don't have a `SameSite` attribute defined. As the Servlet specification lacks an API to set the `SameSite` attribute on Cookie objects, Open Liberty provides a way of setting the attribute in the server configuration in order to minimize application-level changes.
